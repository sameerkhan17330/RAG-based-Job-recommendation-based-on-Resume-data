Lorenzo Zackery / myvt.me@gmail.com /​215 . 980 . 1011,N/A,"I've been a WordPress Developer for 13 years now. I've worked with big name marketing agencies in midtown Manhattan as well as Philadelphia. I’ve had clients from New York down to Atlanta all the way to Chicago to San Francisco. My biggest project to date was for IBM with a budget of $100 million. I’ve also flexed my remote capabilities by taking on an international client for a startup based in Tokyo which is a 13hr time difference. I'm more than capable of taking on any WordPress role as I’m a proven WP developer who specializes in Full Stacks (FE/BE), Site/Database Migrations, Theme/Plugin Configurations, PSD to HTML and every WordPress task in between. I simply love WordPress and I am deeply rooted in the WordPress online community.; Half (references available). Projects range from full stacks, frontend, backend, wordpress migrations, theme/plugin configurations, PSD to html. Biggest project to date was Burlington Coat Factory (one million dollar budget) Worked in teams consisting of project managers, graphic designers, marketing directors, social media directors, IT managers, VP’s, CTO’s, CFO’s, CEO’s and owners. Worked remotely in all 4 continental time zones as well as one international time zone (Tokyo). Worked on personal Wordpress Projects (contracted youtuber) that have reached traffic upwards of 100k monthly visitors with an A from Google analytics within 10 months of launching. Built a free music streaming service consisting of social media, spotify and youtube API’s. Used by thousand of users a day.; This contract role was a full stack role for a corporate staffing agency. The site featured a company job board along with compatibility with all internet browsers as well as mobile compatibility. This project started as a migration then transitioned into a full stack then turned to a management/maintenance of the company site after project completion.; This was a full stack project that I was flown to Chicago for. The $100 million government project was to revamp Cook County’s internal website. Cook county is the 2nd biggest county (after LA county in California) in the United States. A little over 24,000 employees are planned to use this site on a daily basis for all various types of county tasks & jobs. A team of 14 worked on or contributed to the project but I was the lone Wordpress “expert” to guide county officials, content writers, project manager, and designers from IBM on best CMS/Wordpress practices for a successful project.; site, fixing any bugs created from the previous developers. I worked predominantly remote with both the New York office and Ohio office. I assist the Marketing Department in Creating new landing pages for the new credit Unions coming aboard. I assisted in all photoshop files that were used in every WordPress site. I lead daily onsite/google hangout production meetings with the CEO, Marketing Department, Project Managers and Software Engineers in ALL WordPress related matters; This was a remote position where the objective was building the client's website/blog before deadline. The client had a website built entirely in HTML code and wanted to translate the site into WordPress. Based on my knowledge of the theme manipulation via code I was able to mimic the previous company website on WordPress ahead of schedule which allow me the extra time saved for site testing protocol.; PSD from the graphics dept on site. My job was to redo the entire company website in according the project managers, account manager and VP’s layout..
